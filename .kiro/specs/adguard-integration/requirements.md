# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature integrates the AdGuard Core library into a React Native application to provide comprehensive ad blocking, tracker blocking, popup prevention, and redirect blocking capabilities within WebViews. The solution must work for both main pages and nested iframes, providing real-time filtering with minimal performance impact and maintaining React Native development workflow compatibility.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a mobile app developer, I want to integrate AdGuard Core library as a native module, so that I can provide ad blocking capabilities across both Android and iOS platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app is built for Android THEN the system SHALL integrate AdGuard Core library using Gradle/CMake build system
2. WHEN the app is built for iOS THEN the system SHALL integrate AdGuard Core library using CocoaPods
3. WHEN the native library is integrated THEN the system SHALL create platform-specific bridges (JNI for Android, Objective-C++ for iOS) to expose filtering functions
4. WHEN the integration is complete THEN the app size increase SHALL be less than 5MB
5. WHEN the library is integrated THEN the system SHALL target Android API 24+ and iOS 13+ minimum versions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a React Native developer, I want a simple JavaScript API for ad blocking controls, so that I can easily manage ad blocking functionality from my application code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AdBlocker module is imported THEN the system SHALL expose `AdBlocker.init()` method for initialization
2. WHEN `AdBlocker.enable()` is called THEN the system SHALL activate ad blocking for all WebViews
3. WHEN `AdBlocker.disable()` is called THEN the system SHALL deactivate ad blocking for all WebViews
4. WHEN `AdBlocker.filterRequest(url: string)` is called THEN the system SHALL return a boolean indicating whether the URL should be blocked
5. WHEN any AdBlocker method is called THEN the system SHALL maintain React Native hot reload compatibility
6. WHEN the JavaScript API is used THEN the system SHALL provide simple toggle functionality without breaking the React Native bundler

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an end user, I want ads, trackers, popups, and redirects to be blocked in WebViews, so that I have a cleaner and safer browsing experience within the app.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a WebView loads content on Android THEN the system SHALL use `WebViewClient.shouldInterceptRequest` to intercept all network requests
2. WHEN a WebView loads content on iOS THEN the system SHALL use `WKURLSchemeHandler` or `NSURLProtocol` to intercept network requests
3. WHEN any network request is made from a WebView THEN the system SHALL filter requests for main pages, iframes, and AJAX calls
4. WHEN a request matches ad/tracker/popup/redirect patterns THEN the system SHALL block the request before page rendering
5. WHEN content is blocked THEN the system SHALL not cause UI lag or performance degradation
6. WHEN filtering is active THEN the system SHALL work in real-time without noticeable delays

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an app maintainer, I want the ad blocking system to support dynamic filter updates, so that the blocking remains effective against new ads and tracking methods.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system initializes THEN the system SHALL load AdGuard filter lists
2. WHEN filter lists are updated THEN the system SHALL support dynamic reloading without app restart
3. WHEN new filter rules are available THEN the system SHALL be able to update filtering patterns
4. WHEN filter updates occur THEN the system SHALL maintain blocking effectiveness for new ad/tracker patterns
5. WHEN filters are updated THEN the system SHALL not interrupt ongoing WebView sessions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a React Native developer, I want the ad blocking integration to be lightweight and performant, so that it doesn't negatively impact my app's user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ad blocking is active THEN the system SHALL maintain lightweight operation with minimal memory footprint
2. WHEN requests are being filtered THEN the system SHALL process filtering decisions in real-time without UI blocking
3. WHEN the app is running THEN the system SHALL not cause performance degradation in React Native hot reload
4. WHEN WebViews are loading content THEN the system SHALL not introduce noticeable loading delays
5. WHEN multiple WebViews are active THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent filtering efficiently
